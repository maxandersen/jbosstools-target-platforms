Proposal for updates to targetplatforms

We need to be careful about our targetplatform not growing or change
too uncontrollable. Below is a suggestion for a process that attempts
to find middleground between being able to add anything by developers
for testing and exploration but once it goes into the master repo it
should have gone through a sanity check that goes beyond just "can it
compile".
 
Step 1: Create Jira based on template

Step 2: Create Pull-request with changes

Step 3: Send email to jbosstools-dev@lists.jboss.org requesting feedback

Step 4: Await approvals from build, affected team leads and project lead(s).
        
In case of urgency build + one project lead is considered ok, but should be the exception.
